# This is the Breaking Bad App!

Hellou da! Breaking Bad App is the first app ever made about Breaking Bad characters and their status. Mocked up and developped with **HTML, Sass and JS** Breakind Bad App allows you to travel all around Breaking Bad characters to find and choose your favorites.

- **See all characters and their status**: when loading the page you will be directly connected to the https://breakingbadapi.com/ that will show you on screen all Breaking Bad Characters, their names and their status.

* **Find your favorites**: using the search engine at the top of the page you will be able to travel all around characters to find your favorite ones (if a character had already been chosen as a favorite it will show up as selected).

* **Fill your favorites list**: clicking on characters you will be able to attach them to your favorites list on the left to have them always on the spot. This list will be saved in your Local Storage showing you your favorites whenever you enter the page again and updating any changes you may make over the list.

* **Change your mind**: whenever you decide a character lost its favorite condition you will be able to eliminate it from the list just by clicking again on its card on the right list or by clicking on the "x" button attached at the top of the character in the favorites list.

* **I don't like any of them anymore!**: If you decide to change radically your Breaking Bad favorite list, you can do it just by clicking on the "reset favorites" button on the top of the favorites list to eliminate all the favorites you have chosen so far.
